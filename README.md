## 🚀 Quick Start

**You don't need to be a coding expert.** We made a simple script to set everything up for you.

### 1. Setup
Runs in seconds. Opens a menu to choose "Essentials" (recommended) or "Full" mode.
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

### 2. Usage
Just tell it what you want to do in plain English.

**From your terminal:**
```powershell
.\activate-skills.ps1 "Make a modern landing page"
```

**Inside Antigravity:**
```
/activate-skills Make a modern landing page
```

## 💡 Why use this?

- **For Vibe Coders**: You rely on AI to build. This tool ensures your AI has the *exact* instructions it needs without you managing files manually.
- **No Memorization**: Forget about "which skill do I need for SEO?". Just type "SEO" and let the Optimizer decide.
- **Always Updated**: We pull the latest skills directly from the source.
